# ðŸŽµ Songkick Concert Finder

A Next.js application to search for artists and view their upcoming concerts using the Songkick API.

## ðŸš§ Current Status

**Update [September 2024]:** Songkick is currently not issuing new API keys due to ongoing improvements to their API. This has temporarily paused the full implementation of the concert search functionality in this project. I am closely monitoring the situation and will integrate the API as soon as it becomes available.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Despite the API limitation, the foundational work of the application has been set up, demonstrating my expertise in building scalable and maintainable web applications.

### **Implemented Features:**

- **Project Setup:**
  - Initialized a Next.js 14 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
  - Configured ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistency.
- **Component Development:**
  - Built the `EventList`, `EventCard` and `ArtistSearch` components to display events.
  - Established routing and navigation structure.
- **API Integration Preparation:**
  - Created the API route handler in `src/app/api/search/route.ts` for future integration with Songkick API.
